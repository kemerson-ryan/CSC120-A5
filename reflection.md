- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Association makes sense to be able to make other objects, but having the instances of the body parts, then parameters to make the scarecrow relabelling the parts kind of confuses me. It is a nice conveniant organization of the code into the different files. I feel like I get lost in my code having it all just scrolling and scrolling, rather than on different pages or being able to color code things like I would in my notes.

Adivce for students in the future, the pattern is already set up in the assignment's Scarecrow class, just follow it. The hardest part for me was trying to pass the message from the command line into the banner class. I wasn't sure how to do that having the message string being after the new instance of Scarecrow, after the message is passed into the banner for it. I moved it above. Also, I had some confusion with scope while working on it.

I began my assignment working alongside Janna Gillesman, and Chelsea Fowler, we just admired each others' pumpkin pieces.
